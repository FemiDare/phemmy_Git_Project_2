Git Project 2

INITIALIZING A GIT REPOSITORY

I start by making a new directory or working folder using the "mkdir" command. The new working folder to be created was named "devops_classes"

I then changed directory or moved into the working directory/folder using the "cd" command

I initialized a git repository in the working folder using the command ".git init"

I created a text file, "index.txt", in the working directory using the "touch" command

Using the "echo" command, I wrote and saved a string of texts to the created file "index.txt

The changes were added to the git staging area using the command line "git add ."

The command line "git commit -m "initial commit"" was used to commit the changes to git
