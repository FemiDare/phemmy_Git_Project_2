Git Project 2

INITIALIZING A GIT REPOSITORY

I start by making a new directory or working folder using the "mkdir" command. The new working folder to be created was named "devops_classes"

I then changed directory or moved into the working directory/folder using the "cd" command.

I initialized a git repository in the working folder using the command ".git init"

I created a text file, "index.txt", in the working directory using the "touch" command

Using the "echo" command, I wrote and saved a string of texts to the created file "index.txt.

The changes were added to the git staging area using the command line "git add ."

The command line "git commit -m "initial commit"" was used to commit the changes to git.

Next I created a new branch using the command line "git checkout -b". The new branch name being "sub1". The flag "-b" is used to switch to the new branch as it is created.

I used the command "git branch" to display the branches on the git repository. Note that the currently active branch is displayed in green with an asterisk preceding it.

I created two new additional branches to the "main" branch namely "sub1" and "sub2".

I proceeded to create a text file under branch "sub2" named "subfile2.txt". Then added it to the staging area and commited the changes.

Using the SWITCH command, I switched to the branch "sub1" and took note of the contents of this branch.

Using the MERGE command I proceeded to merge the "sub2" branch with the "sub1" branch and then verified that the text file created in sub2 branch has been sent to sub1 hence confirming the merger.

I then proceeded to delete the branch "sub2" using the "git branch -d" command.
